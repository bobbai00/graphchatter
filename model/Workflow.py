# the abstraction of workflows
# Methods
# 1. GetOperators(a list of operator type) -> a list of operators, if given list of types are none empty, filter and only keep those operators that of those types
# 2. GetLinks() -> a list of links(between these operators)
# 3. GetSubWorkflowByIndex(idx: int) -> (Workflow, one operator, a list of link related to that operator): this method will topologically sort the operators in the workflow, and
#    it will return a sub workflow containing operator [0, idx-1], the idx-th operator, the links connected to this idx-th operator.
